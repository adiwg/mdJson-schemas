  "description": "A GeoJSON object MAY have a member named 'bbox' to include information on the coordinate range for its Geometries, Features, or FeatureCollections. The value of the bbox member MUST be an array of length 2 * n where n is the number of dimensions represented in the contained geometries, with all axes of the most southwesterly point followed by all axes of the more northeasterly point. The axes order of a bbox follows the axes order of geometries. The values of a 'bbox' array are[west, south, east, north].",
